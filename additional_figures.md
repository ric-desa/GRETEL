# Scatter Grid: GED vs Cosine Similarity
This figure shows a grid of scatter plots (one subplot per dataset), where each point represents an explainer’s average counterfactual (CF) performance in that dataset. The x-axis is the log₁₀ of Graph Edit Distance (GED), indicating how much the CF deviates from the original graph, while the y-axis is the Cosine Similarity (CS) of node embeddings, indicating how semantically similar the CF is to the original. Each explainer is represented by a different marker and color, consistent across all datasets. This visualization highlights the trade-off between counterfactual minimality (low GED) and semantic meanign (high CS), making it easy to compare explainers across datasets.

# CS violin-distribution
This figure shows violin plots of the Cosine Similarity (CS) distributions per explainer and per dataset, arranged in a grid. Each violin represents how semantically close the generated counterfactuals are to the original graph in terms of node embedding similarity, aggregated across embeddings. Consistent colors and order of explainers across subplots make it straightforward to compare semantic behavior across explainers and datasets, highlighting which explainers maintain high semantic similarity and which sacrifice it to produce more diverse or further-reaching counterfactuals.

# GED violin-distribution
This figure displays violin plots of the GED distributions for each explainer, organized in a grid with one subplot per dataset. Each violin reflects the distribution of graph edit distances for all counterfactuals generated by a particular explainer. The x-axis shows explainer names, and colors are kept consistent across datasets. Using a log scale for GED, this plot enables comparison of how “difficult” or “large” the counterfactuals are for different explainers and datasets, revealing which explainers tend to produce more minimal or more radical changes.
